    Another thought:
        - Pokemon type game
            - user can mint a mon and add it to their 'party'
            - party is 4 mons
            - mons are randomly selected at mint
            - mons have an attack and defense
            - mons can attack the opponent or defend the user
            - mons can level up after a win

        User interaction:
            - user selects their party and look for a match
            - user plays 1 mon per turn, or attacks/defends
            - user loses if all mons die, or user health pool hits 0
            - winners mons receive 'exp'. level is based on total exp, exponential level up. 92 is half of 99
    -
